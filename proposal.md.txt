# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Choose Your Fate 

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A game in RenPy where you have to make the right choices to get the good ending

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

The software will launch a game where you have to make the right choices to escape a complex or building (maybe). You will be prompted where to go and what choice to make to succeed. If the person makes the wrong choice, they'll die in game.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A good outcome would be that the game is playable with both good and bad endings resulting as intended

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

A better ending would be that the game is finished as intended, maybe with voiced lines.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

The game is extremely polished for what it is, with voice lines and background music.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

First thing I will need to do is outline and know what the skeleton of the code will be. Then, I'll need to know how to apply what I know about Python into RenPy. Once, I have a grasp on RenPy after researching its mechanics, I can start the coding process.
